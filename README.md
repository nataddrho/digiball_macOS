# DigiBallScanner
This is a macOS application for scanning DigiBall devices with Bluetooth LE and generating an image (.png) of the tip contact position when new shots are detected. The image can be used as an overlay for streaming software such as OBS. Adding a video delay of 6s (or more) to the main feed will cause the generated graphic to appear slightly before the player shoots. This may be desirable.

Mac computer with BT 4.0 or greater

### Installation:

This app is released in the Apple Store as "DigiBallScanner". Alternatively you may download and compile it yourself with XCode.
